<h1>Welcome to the x-mad search engine</h1> 

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>UPDATE </h2>
<p>We were down for a few days, looks like thepiratebay and kat.ph decided to encode and compress their pages that we were spidering... This will not stop us of course, so here we are up again :)</p>
<h2>Extend / Open Source</h2>

<p>Good things should be free, and open source. You can <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad" target="_blank">fork this project on github</a> or contribute to the code, <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/issues" target="_blank">request features, post issues</a> or even setup your own search engine like this by ripping this site off, I won't mind, the more the merrier. To install it on your server, you just need to <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/zipball/master">grab a copy</a> from github and unzip it to your php host. Then change some things in the &quot;customize&quot; folder (like logos, social buttons,analytics) and you are done. You can also <a href="mailto:info@x-mad.com">email</a> me </p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>currently x-mad spiders <a href="thepiratebay.se" target="_blank">thepiratebay.se</a>, <a href="http://eztv.it" target="_blank">eztv.it</a> and <a href="fenopy.eu" target="_blank">fenopy.eu</a> for magnet links. We also spider <a href="blockbuster.co.uk" target="_blank">blockbuster.co.uk</a> for movie posters and <a href="bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">bbc.co.uk</a> for top music songs. New sources will be added every day</p>
