<h1>Welcome to the x-mad search engine</h1> 

<h2>UPDATE </h2>
<p>Sorry but I have to shorten my urls to hide the magnets from this website. Whenever you click on a magnet link you will have to wait on the next page for 5seconds, then &quot;skip ad&quot; and you will be rolling. Just do not be tempted to click any of the ads! they are just ads!:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>NEW PROJECT </h2>
<p>Using the x-mad.com engine I am building <a href="http://onlinemovies.pw">onlinemovies.pw</a> This is a wordpress theme and functionality is quite simple. You just apply the theme and you are done!!! every 10 minutes a new movie is spidered from imdb and entered in your worpdress database with everything. For all the movies the x-mad engine provides the results from the magnet sites we spider :) Source code to be released soon!</p>
<h2>UPDATE </h2>
<p>Looks like everyone is looking for porn here.. So a new section (porn) has been added. Like always, nothing is stored on this server, just fresh content with no ads. Visit the <a href="http://www.x-mad.com/porn.php">porn section</a> now!  :)</p>
<h2>Extend / Open Source</h2>

<p>Good things should be free, and open source. You can <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad" target="_blank">fork this project on github</a> or contribute to the code, <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/issues" target="_blank">request features, post issues</a> or even setup your own search engine like this by ripping this site off, I won't mind, the more the merrier. To install it on your server, you just need to <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/zipball/master">grab a copy</a> from github and unzip it to your php host. Then change some things in the &quot;customize&quot; folder (like logos, social buttons,analytics) and you are done. You can also <a href="mailto:info@x-mad.com">email</a> me </p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>currently x-mad spiders <a href="thepiratebay.se" target="_blank">thepiratebay.se</a>, <a href="http://eztv.it" target="_blank">eztv.it</a> and <a href="fenopy.eu" target="_blank">fenopy.eu</a> for magnet links. We also spider <a href="blockbuster.co.uk" target="_blank">blockbuster.co.uk</a> for movie posters and <a href="bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">bbc.co.uk</a> for top music songs. New sources will be added every day</p>
